# Counter
# Complete the counter function definition so that it returns the number of characters for every input word.

# Note 1: You don't have to call the function unless you are explicitly required to do so. Defining the function is enough. However, if you like to call your function under your function definition, that's fine too.

# Note 2: Click on instructor_solution.py if you want to view the solution. You need to put that solution inside exercise.py if you want to check if it works.
