# Commented Functions
# Suppose your colleague started to write two functions but then he/she got busy with another task and left the task to you. 
# Try to complete those two function definitions based on the #comments your colleague left in the code.

# Function gets a list, converts it to tuple and returns the tuple
def list_to_tuple(lst):
    result = tuple(lst)
    return result

# Function gets any Python object and converts it into a string
def object_to_string(object):
    return str(object)
